# This directory is for storing datasets after they have been preprocessed
# and are ready for model training or evaluation.
# Examples:
# - Images resized, normalized, or augmented for OCR/image embedding models.
# - Text data cleaned, tokenized, and formatted for NLP models.
# - Image-text pairs prepared for multimodal model training.
# - TFRecords, PyTorch .pt files, or other serialized data formats.
#
# Like the 'raw' directory, large processed files may be better stored
# externally, with this directory containing metadata, samples, or generation scripts.
