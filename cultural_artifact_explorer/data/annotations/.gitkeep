# This directory is for storing annotation files related to the datasets.
# These files provide labels or other metadata crucial for supervised learning.
#
# Examples:
# - OCR annotations: JSON or XML files with bounding boxes and transcribed text for images.
# - NER annotations: CoNLL format files, JSON (e.g., spaCy format) with tagged entities.
# - Translation alignments: Parallel corpora in TMX or simple text file formats.
# - Image captions: JSON or CSV files linking images to their textual descriptions for retrieval models.
# - Vocabulary files or character lists: .txt files listing unique characters for OCR/NLP models.
# - Label maps: .json files mapping string labels to integer IDs for classification tasks.
#
# These annotation files are usually text-based and can be version-controlled with Git.
