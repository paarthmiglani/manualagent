# This directory should contain a small, representative sample of data
# that can be used for:
# - Quick testing of scripts and pipelines.
# - Demonstrations or examples.
# - Unit tests requiring data inputs.
#
# Examples:
# - A few sample artifact images (.jpg, .png).
# - Short text excerpts in various Indic scripts.
# - Sample annotation files corresponding to the images/texts.
#
# These files should be small enough to be committed to Git.
