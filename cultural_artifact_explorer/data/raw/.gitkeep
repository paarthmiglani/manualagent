# This directory is intended for storing original, unmodified datasets.
# Examples:
# - Raw images of cultural artifacts.
# - Original text documents, manuscripts, or inscriptions.
# - Collections of parallel text for translation.
#
# Due to size, large datasets might be referenced here via download scripts
# or documentation, rather than being committed directly to the Git repository.
