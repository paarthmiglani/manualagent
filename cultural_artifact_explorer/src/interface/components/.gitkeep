# This directory is intended for custom UI components that might be used
# in the Streamlit application or a React frontend.
# Examples:
# - Reusable Streamlit components (e.g., custom artifact card display).
# - If using React, this would hold JavaScript/TypeScript component files (.jsx, .tsx).
#
# For a pure Streamlit app with simple structure, this might remain empty or
# contain Python files defining functions that render complex Streamlit elements.
