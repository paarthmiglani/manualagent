# This directory is for storing trained multimodal retrieval model checkpoints,
# vector indexes, and related files.
# Examples:
# - Image embedding models: e.g., image_encoder_resnet50_final.pth
# - Text embedding models: e.g., text_encoder_bert_final.pth
# - Joint image-text models (CLIP-like): e.g., custom_clip_epoch20.pt
# - Saved vector indexes: e.g., artifact_image_index.faiss, text_descriptions_index.ann
# - Metadata files associated with vector indexes if not stored alongside.
#
# Manage large files (model weights, large indexes) using Git LFS or external storage.
# Configuration files are in `configs/`.
# Training logs can be stored here or in a dedicated `logs/` directory.
