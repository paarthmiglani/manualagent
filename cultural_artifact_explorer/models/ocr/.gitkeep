# This directory is intended for storing trained OCR model checkpoints,
# weights, and any associated files (e.g., model architecture definitions if not in code).
# Examples:
# - OCR text detection model: e.g., craft_mlt_25k.pth, east_model.pb
# - OCR text recognition model: e.g., crnn_devanagari_best.pth, transformer_ocr_tamil.ckpt
# - Vocabulary or character map files specific to a trained model instance if not in data/annotations.
#
# Large model files should ideally be managed using Git LFS or stored in a dedicated
# model repository/cloud storage, with this directory perhaps containing download scripts or links.
# Configuration files for these models should be in the `configs/` directory.
# Training logs might also be stored here or in a separate `logs/` directory.
