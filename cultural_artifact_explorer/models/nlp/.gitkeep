# This directory is for storing trained NLP model checkpoints and related files.
# Examples:
# - Translation models: e.g., seq2seq_hindi_to_english.h5, marian_mt_finetuned_tamil_english.zip
# - Summarization models: e.g., summarizer_bart_custom.pt
# - NER models: e.g., ner_bilstm_crf_cultural_entities.model, transformer_ner.bin
# - Tokenizer model files/vocabularies specific to a trained NLP model instance:
#   e.g., sentencepiece.model, vocab.txt, merges.txt for Hugging Face tokenizers.
#
# As with other model directories, manage large files appropriately (Git LFS, cloud storage).
# Corresponding configuration files are in `configs/`.
# Training logs can be stored here or in a dedicated `logs/` directory.
