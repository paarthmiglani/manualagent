# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This directory will store cleaned, augmented, and preprocessed data
# that is ready to be fed into the model training pipelines.
#
# Examples:
# - Annotated images for OCR training
# - Parallel corpora for translation model training
# - Tokenized and indexed text for language models
# - Pre-computed embeddings (if applicable)
#
# Similar to 'datasets/', large processed files might be handled
# via external storage, with this directory containing metadata or samples.
