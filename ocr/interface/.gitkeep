# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This directory will contain the frontend interface for the application.
# Examples:
# - A Streamlit app for rapid prototyping
# - A React-based web application for a more polished user experience
#
# The interface should allow users to:
# - Upload an image to trigger the OCR, NLP, and retrieval pipeline
# - Enter a text query to search for semantically related artifact images
