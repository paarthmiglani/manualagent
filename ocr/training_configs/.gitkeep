# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This directory will hold configuration files for training the various models.
#
# Examples:
# - YAML or JSON files specifying hyperparameters for OCR models
# - Configuration for NLP model training (e.g., sequence lengths, batch sizes)
# - Settings for training image and text embedding models
#
# Keeping configurations separate from code allows for easier experimentation
# and reproducibility.
