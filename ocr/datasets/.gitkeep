# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This directory is intended for storing raw datasets used for training
# the OCR, NLP, and retrieval models.
#
# Due to potential size, actual data files might be stored elsewhere
# (e.g., cloud storage) and this directory might contain:
# - Download scripts
# - Sample data
# - README files describing the datasets and their sources
