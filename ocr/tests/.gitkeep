# This file is intentionally left blank.
# It's a common convention to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This directory will contain unit and integration tests for the project.
# (Currently TBD as per project description)
#
# Examples:
# - Unit tests for individual functions/modules (e.g., OCR accuracy on sample images)
# - Integration tests for pipelines (e.g., end-to-end OCR -> NLP -> Retrieval flow)
#
# A good testing suite is crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring
# the reliability of the models and pipelines. Frameworks like PyTest or unittest
# can be used.
